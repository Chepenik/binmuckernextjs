## Why a Blog?

I already write every day on [Medium](https://medium.com/@chepenikconor), but I wanted a place on my own site to share updates about the projects I'm building, lessons I'm learning, and ideas I'm exploring.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover:

- **Bitcoin & Lightning** — Tools, education, and the future of sound money
- **Building in Public** — Behind-the-scenes of projects like the [Bitcoin Coloring Book](https://bitcoincoloring.com/), [Sound Money Mortgage](https://soundmoneymortgage.com/), and [Saylorscope](https://www.saylorscope.com/)
- **Web Development** — Things I learn while building with Next.js, React, and TypeScript
- **Health & Wellness** — Breathing exercises, cold exposure, and taking care of yourself

## Stay Tuned
